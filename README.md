# Autonomous Navigation on a Duckiebot
## This project runs on Ubuntu Linux
## Duckiebot is a low-cost platform for robotics education, which provides an ideal testbed for exploring computer vision techniques in autonomous navigation [1]. This project aims to integrate homography estimation, AprilTag detection, optical flow, and augmented reality (AR) to enable a Duckiebot to navigate lanes, avoid obstacles, and enhance visualization. Motivated by the need to apply classroom concepts like perspective transforms and feature tracking, I developed a ROS-based system to process the Duckiebotâ€™s camera feed in real-time. The system achieves robust lane following, precise AprilTag-based stopping, and obstacle avoidance, while AR overlays add an interactive dimension.
