# Autonomous Navigation on a Duckiebot
## This project runs on Ubuntu Linux

## Introduction
This project transforms a Duckiebot, an affordable robotics education platform, into an autonomous navigation system. By integrating advanced computer vision techniques, the Duckiebot can follow lanes, avoid obstacles, detect specific markers to stop, and display augmented reality (AR) overlays. Built using the Robot Operating System (ROS), this system processes the Duckiebotâ€™s camera feed in real-time, making it a practical tool for learning about robotics and autonomous driving.
